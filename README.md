It's basically plug n' play. <br> <br>

1. Download the zip. <br>
2. Extract the zip. <br>
3. Inside the folder, copy/cut index.php AND the dashboard folder. <br>
4. Paste in C:\laragon\www folder <br>
5. Start up localhost like usual. <br> <br>

The newly added index.php will open by default upon localhost start in browser and redirect you into dashboard/index.php which is where everything is located.
