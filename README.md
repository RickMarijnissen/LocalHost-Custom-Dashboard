It's basically plug n' play. <br> <br>

1. Download the zip. <br>
2. Extract the zip. <br>
3. Inside the folder, copy/cut index.php AND the custom_dashboard folder. <br>
4. Paste in C:\xampp\htdocs folder <br>
5. It WILL replace the existing index.php which is also a redirect but to the xampp localhost site instead. So if you want you can back it up but eh. <br>
6. Start up localhost like usual. <br> <br>

The newly added index.php will open by default upon localhost start in browser and redirect you into custom_dashboard/index.php which is where everything is located.
